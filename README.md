# Gyms
It is a project for learning frontend and backend. 
Gyms is a website that shows information about certain gyms. You can create new gym, update it or delete. The information about gyms is stored in a SQLite database. 

I'm editing this project now, adding new technologies(React, Redux). The link for the new [gyms repository](https://github.com/petrokss/new_gyms)
